# rps
A simple implementation of rock, paper and scissors game using pygame.

Press "r" to choose rock.

Press "p" to choose paper.

Press "s" to choose scissors.

Press "q" to quit.

Further improvement: 

1.	Now the player is playing against a random player (generates a pseudo-random number to determine move), I can make two human players play against each other.

2.	Make a scoreboard to record the overall number of victories.
